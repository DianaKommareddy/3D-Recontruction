# 3D-Recontruction
## Dataset
This project supports the KITTI and TUM RGB-D datasets. You can download them from:
- [KITTI Odometry Dataset](http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/)

## Installation
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Open3D
- NumPy
- OpenCV
- Intel RealSense SDK (if using RealSense cameras)

  ## Features
- Uses RGB-D images for depth-based reconstruction.
- Implements point cloud processing with Open3D.
- Supports depth image filtering and noise reduction.
- Outputs reconstructed 3D meshes and point clouds.

  ##Practice files
http://localhost:8888/lab/tree/open3d_data - contains practice files on point cloud creation and using Open3D
